There is no joint venture, association, partnership, employment or agency relationship exists between this app (PCSO Quick Pick) and Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office.
<br><br>PCSO lotto games 6/42, 6/45, 6/49, 6/55, and 6/58<br><br>
PCSO Quick Pick does NOT store and/or analyze any previous winning numbers of any PCSO Lotto games. It also does NOT predict future winning combination. You can think of it as just like PCSO Lotto "Lucky Pick" number generator, but it allows you to generate as many times as you want.
<br><br>
PCSO Quick Pick does not gaurantee a 100% winning combination. This app will just provide you with combinations that are random, yet with increased chances of winning, use it at your own descrition.
<br><br>
What do you mean by "increased chances"?
As you may already know, lottery is all about "probability". 
<br><br>
How does this app generate numbers?
- It uses the odd and even numbers strategy.

- It does not choose more than 2 consecutive numbers. The sequences 1,2,3 and 57,58,59 are definitely ones to avoid.

- It does not choose multiples of a number (with or without an offset). Multiples of 5 are definitely ones to avoid, because the playslip rows are in multiples of 5, so if you've picked 1,6,11,16,21,26 or 5,10,15,20,25,30, then go right to the back of the class.

- It chooses at least one number above 31, because loads of people will use ALL birthdates and you need to make sure that you aren't one of them.

- It does not pick more than 2 numbers that are less than or equal to 12, because these clash with months as well as birthdates.

- It makes sure that at least one of the numbers isn't in the union set of the most/least frequent winning numbers. This union set is calculated by combining the 6 (or more) most and 6 (or more) least frequent winning numbers.

- It does not choose any of previous draw's sets of 6 winning numbers, there's bound to be some people who'll try this.

Lastly, purchase more than one ticket, the more tickets purchased will definitely increase your odds of winning, and of course, always check the lottery results!
